Group project for Assignment no.7

## Description 📜
This is a group project to create a website using:
* 2 server-side API's, 
* using client-side storage,
* and using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. 
The application must be interactive and not use alerts, confirms or prompts. 

## Motivation 💪🏻
This project was created to help comic book enthusiasts find the latest MARVEL comics by linking the selection of comics on the landing page to the MARVEL data via an API key. The site will allow users to save their favourte comics to a reading list and show them via Google maps where they can buy the comics in person at a local store. Being able to refesh the selection of comics available will ensure that the user is always presented with the most up to date comics to choose from.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
I am a comic book enthusiast and I like to discover NEW comics to read and also where to purchase them from.
* WHEN I search for new comics to review or purchase
THEN I am presented with current issues of comics by MARVEL generated by an API key.

THEN I am presented with further information about the comic including an image, title, author, blurb and an option to find where it is sold in stores.
* WHEN I click on the 'Find Comic Store' button
THEN I am presented with a map that links via API to show me where my nearest comic books store is so I can view it in person and purchase it.
* WHEN I click on 'Add to Reading list' 
THEN I can save my favourite comics to a personalised list stored in the local user storage.
