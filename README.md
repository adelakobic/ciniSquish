Group project for Assignment no.7

## Description 📜
This is a group project to create a website using:
* 2 server-side API's, 
* using client-side storage,
* and using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. 
The application must be interactive and not use alerts, confirms or prompts. 

## Motivation 💪🏻
This project was created to help comic book enthusiasts find the latest MARVEL comics by linking the selection of comics on the landing page to the MARVEL data via an API key. The site will allow users to save their favourte comics to a reading list and show them via Google maps where they can buy the comics in person at a local store. Being able to refesh the selection of comics available will ensure that the user is always presented with the most up to date comics to choose from.
